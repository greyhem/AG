<h3>Mumbai</h3>
<p>
Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Along with the neighboring suburbs of Navi Mumbai and Thane, it forms, at 19 

million, the world’s fifth most populous metropolitan area. As the financial and entertainment capital of India, Mumbai’s business opportunities, as well as its 

potential to offer a better standard of living, attract migrants from all over India.
</p><p>
Yet despite Mumbai’s promise of opportunity, more and more children on the city’s streets face a fight for survival. You see them everywhere, yet you prefer to ignore 

them. They polish your shoes, clean your car, deliver tea, sell roses at traffic signals, hawk newspapers and shiny trinkets on the train and even sift through toxic 

garbage piles to recycle plastic waste. Local NGOs put their number at 20,000, but the United Nations estimates that there are about2.5 lakh street children in Mumbai. 
</p><p>
Poverty forces them into work, beggary and abusive situations. Many are homeless and ought to be protected under rehabilitative schemes as they are vulnerable to 

exploitation and abuse.
</p><h3>
Uttan Mother House
</h3><p>
We get children from various areas in Mumbai, including Virar, Nala Sopara, Vasai, Grant Road, Chambur, Dadar, and Mira Road. Although all of our residents were 

rescued from Mumbai, their origins range throughout India (Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, etc.) and Nepal.
</p><h3>
Bhayander Extension Home
</h3><p>
Bhayander is a city located 8km from Uttan. We have an extension home for our senior girls who work and study in Bhayander to complete their higher education and learn 

to support themselves.

							Amcha Ghar accepts orphaned, semi-orphaned, neglected and abandoned girls. We work with rejected children, orphans who do not know their origin, children of commercial sex workers, children abused by their relatives, children who have witnessed the suicide of family members, and children deserted due to poverty and hardship. Some girls’ parents have contracted HIV/AIDS and are unable to care for them, although the girls themselves do not have HIV.<br>

Some were sold to brothels in other states, expected to suffer the pain in silence; others resorted to glue-sniffing to escape daily physical and emotional duress. These children are often found in unhygienic conditions on streets and beaches, or in parks, parking lots, or slums.<br>

Girls generally come to Amcha Ghar after five years of age, although exceptions are made for emergencies. We provide a safe, loving environment to support their growth until they have completed their education and/or vocational training and can provide for themselves as successful adult women.<br>

                            <p>For the majority of street children, street life seems to them to be their only means of survival. As girls, they are exposed to pimps, violence, sexual abuse and communities that despise them through lack of understanding of their experiences and reasons for coming to the streets.<br>

Rescuing children from the dangerous environment of the streets and offering them access to a safe environment is only the first step on the long road to recovery, but it is nonetheless a crucial one.<br>

Through our dedicated team of field social workers and well wishers, including the Mumbai police, we offer children wishing to make a break from street life the opportunity to do so. At the ‘Home’, the staff undertakes the identification and rehabilitation process of each child in order to understand and address their individual needs.<br>

We offer family counseling and parental job placement assistance, with the ultimate aim of strengthening the families so that girls can be reunited with their parents.

                            <p><p>Amcha Ghar is a NGO that provides a residential home for orphaned and semi-orphaned girls from the streets of Mumbai. In the 1990s, Agatha Susheela Dias and Anthony 

Dias were worked as a social worker in the streets of Mumbai. In 1995, they rescued a sexually exploited girl from the Mumbai Street, only to discover that no 

institutions would take her because she was not an orphan. They realized that no home catered to semi-orphan girl child or to those living in vulnerable situations. 

The girls were denied admission in homes if they had a single parent, despite the fact that the single parent often worked all day, leaving the girl to fend for 

herself or placing her in the care of sexually, physically or emotionally abusive relatives. After witnessing such helplessness, Mr. and Mrs. Dias were inspired to 

form a unique organization that would serve those living in such situations.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1996 in Uttan village at Bhayander, a committed team of social workers, attorneys, doctors, and well wishers joined Mr. and Mrs. Dias to give birth to 

Amcha Ghar. Starting off with providing a home to three girls, It has grown to a place that is now home to 25 girls and still growing. Since many years It also offers 

education to roughly 500 students in the Amcha Ghar School. They rehabilitated many girls for higher studies, working and their marriage.</p>

<p>Amcha Ghar focuses on early intervention, rescuing and rehabilitating young girls from the streets. When possible, Amcha Ghar also provides counseling and economic 

guidance to girls’ parents or relatives, with the ultimate aim of stabilizing the family environment and improving economic status so girls can be re-united with their 

families. <p>

<p>An identity of self-worth and acceptance is instilled in each child through the healthy family environment at the Amcha Ghar Home. Amcha Ghar now encompasses not 

only a Residential Home in the village of Uttan, but also an Extension Home for older residents who are working and pursuing higher studies in Bhayander. Amcha Ghar 

School provides English Medium formal education for younger beneficiaries as well as children of local fisher folk families. The demeanor and discipline of Amcha Ghar 

girls have earned them a respected reputation in both Uttan and Mumbai. Amcha Ghar strives to produce self-sufficient, empowered young women who can succeed in today’s 

fast-paced and competitive world through settling them back to main stream of society.
